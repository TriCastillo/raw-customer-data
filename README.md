# Context
ABC Retail Corporation recently collected raw customer data from various sales channels for the year 2023. This dataset, stored in an Excel file, includes key customer information such as ID, First Name, Last Name, Gender, Age, Birthday, Items Sold, Email, and Phone Number. However, the data is unprocessed and contains inconsistencies, missing values, and formatting issues that make it unreliable for analysis and reporting.

As part of the company's data quality improvement initiative, you are tasked with cleaning this dataset using Python. Your goal is to prepare a clean and accurate version of the customer data that can be used for further analysis, such as customer segmentation, sales trends, and targeted marketing strategies. This involves detecting and handling missing values, correcting data types and formats, removing duplicates, and standardizing entries across all columns.

The success of this data cleaning project will directly impact the accuracy of business decisions and customer insights derived from the data.
